# DDRobot-Control
This project develops a localization and motion control system for a differential-drive mobile robot using kinematic modeling and real-time trajectory tracking. The control system employs a proportional controller to minimize position and orientation errors, ensuring precise point stabilization. A* pathfinding is integrated for global path planning, while a reactive obstacle avoidance algorithm dynamically adjusts the robot’s trajectory based on proximity-based repulsive forces. The MATLAB simulation validates the system’s performance, demonstrating efficient multi-goal navigation in a dynamic 2D environment with static and randomly placed obstacles.
